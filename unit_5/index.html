                <h3>Why go curbless?</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>A curbless shower is the perfect compromise (and a beautiful one!) when it comes to accommodating the needs of everyone in your home. It offers people of all ages the freedom to safely enter the shower without the need to climb over a threshold or into a tub. A curbless shower caters to everyone’s needs and abilities, and don't we need more more of that today?</p>
